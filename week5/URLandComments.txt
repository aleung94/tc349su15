Notes: not sure why but the laser eyes do not work for me. The code is correct but the animation just won't work. On the projects page the buttons all work. I tested this by using the alert function. The cotter gif appears and disappears and I am able to change the background by clicking the change color button. It is when you use the link above which then none of the buttons work...
