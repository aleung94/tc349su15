My preference is using the style tiles rather than the full comps. But I believed that one should utilize both for design process to create a decent  website. In my opinion the comps is the building blocks while the style tiles are the nails and blots to hold the design. The style tiles give the design more value rather than being bland and boring. 

I should have spent more time on the style tiles. I feel like it isn't my best work. Definitely could have looked for better textures/patterns or even made more of my own. I struggled with that since I was slightly confused as what the textures and patterns were for. The color schemes that I had choosen were decent in my opinion. I feel like I spent more time on the style comps instead of the full comps.
