    <h2>About Me</h2>
	<h3>An ordinary 21 year old...</h3>
    <p>My name is Amy, I am currently studying at Michigan State University. I will be going into my 4th year as a computer science major. I decided to go into computer science after taking a class on programming in high school. It was definitely a choice that made sense for me. I have always loved going on the computer and the "How does this work?" or "How was this created?" just sparked an interests in computing. So like the statement above, I'm just a regular 21 year old girl who enjoys living in the moment.  </p>

    <h2>Interests</h2>
	<h3>Activities and Hobbies</h3>
    <p>Growing up, I was always around family, not just my parents and siblings, but also my grandparents, aunts & uncles, as well as cousins. I love being able to spend time with family and friends.  I enjoy going on my computer, which definitely explains my career path. Not only that, but I also enjoy reading, listening to music and watching TV. </p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
	<h3>What are my future plans?</h3>
    <p>My goals currently include graduating this coming spring and being able to find a decent paying job right after graduation. It is a simple goal for now. Looking at big picture I want to be able to slowly work my way up to being able to develop my owns apps, for different Operating systems and having that be my job.  Currently, I have one application that is out in the Windows 8 App store called "Ninja Shooter". </p>
