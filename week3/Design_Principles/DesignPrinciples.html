		<h1>Design Principles</h1>
			<p>Below are 5 design principles with descriptions and examples.</p>
		<h2>Affordance</h2>
			<img class="resize" src="Tumblr.png">
			<p>This principle states that the design of a website should be simplistic. The function of the design should be easy to use and understand. For example, after signing into Tumblr, one's dashboard has buttons with appropriate symbols displaying it's function (Text, Photo, Quote, Link, Chat, Audio, Video). If you look at the different post, it is noticeable that the buttons for reblog and like are appropriate as well. </p>
		<h2>Chunking</h2>

			<p>This principle states that a website should group information that is relevant. Websites' must "chunk" information for easy scanning purposes.  Wikipedia is a great example of this principle. It chunks information into topics and allows users to find information quicker by providing anchor links to the appropriate section of information.</p>
		<h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
			<img class="resize" src="RitzCamera.png">
			<p>This principle states that a website should have its designs be split into thirds for aesthetic. It is more appealing to users. A good example of this principle is RitzCamera. Looking vertically, it is split into thirds, in the center where the site's products are shown. Horizontally, it is split into the header, center, and footer.</p>
		<h2>Hick's Law</h2>
			<img class="resize" src="CommonWealth.png">
			<p>This principle states that a website should have as little of decision making for a user as possible. The website should be simplistic enough that the user does is not hesitating when making a choice. Commonwealth is a great example of this principle with it's simple design. The menu on the side does not have to many tabs. Even with the sub-tabs, commonwealth is to the point in which a user does not have to spend time thinking of what button to click.</p>
		<h2>Signal-to-Noise Ratio</h2>
			<img class="resize" src="wds.png">
			<p>This principle states that a website should be simple not to overcrowded with irrelevant material. A website under this principle should not have distractions that makes users lose focus on their main point/product. A good example of this principle would be Whole Design Studios. The website is simple. There aren't any distracting things such as ads or even music playing in the background. It is minimalistic in its approach in design. </p>
